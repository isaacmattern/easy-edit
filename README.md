# Easy Edit - A Simple Text Editor

This is a project I am currently working on, following an instruction booklet from [Snaptoken's Build Your Own Text Editor "instruction booklet"](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html).

I have completed the base "tutorial" part of this project, and I am currently working on implementing additional features. 

## Additional Features Currently Implemented:
* Auto-Indentation

## Potential Features for Future Implementation:
* Line numbers
  * Ability to jump to a line number with some key binding like in vim
* Additional filetypes for syntax highlihting (Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc.)
* Copy and Paste
* Config File for quit times, tab and indentation customization, etc. 

The main goal of this project was for me to sharpen my C programming skills outside of my academic work.
