# Easy Edit - A Simple Text Editor

This is a project I am currently working on, following an instruction booklet from [Snaptoken's Build Your Own Text Editor "instruction booklet"](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html).

After I complete the base version, I plan to implement additional features such as auto-indenting, soft-wrap lines, copy and paste, displaying line numbers, and a config-file feature.

The main goal of this project was for me to sharpen my C programming skills outside of my academic work.
